/**
 * Manages audio focus for the media player.
 *
 * This class handles:
 * - Requesting audio focus before playback
 * - Responding to audio focus changes (ducking, pausing)
 * - Releasing audio focus when playback stops
 * - Handling interruptions from phone calls, other apps, etc.
 * - Distinguishing between user-initiated and system-initiated pauses
 *
 * ## Thread Safety
 *
 * The [OnAudioFocusChangeListener] callback may be invoked on a different thread
 * (typically the audio thread). All boolean flags that are read/written from both
 * the main thread and the focus listener are marked as @Volatile to ensure visibility.
 *
 * ExoPlayer methods (play, pause, volume) must be called on the main thread, so
 * the focus listener dispatches these calls via a Handler.
 *
 * Public methods should be called from the main thread.
